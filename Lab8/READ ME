a)
	So this lab wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be. In fact, it was easier since we had most of the psuedo code which solved the figuring out prolem.

	 1) Having the TreeNode inside the BinaryTree class was hard since it was private. Taking it out solved the scope issue there.

b) 
	insert, minimum, maximum, etc. = O(logn) which is height of the tree


c)
	Timing:

	Timing for 1000 inserts in milliseconds: 65.4

	Timing for 2000 inserts in milliseconds: 180.5

	Timing for 3000 inserts in milliseconds: 373.383

	Timing for 10000 inserts in milliseconds: 4023.83

d)
	Probably using a new system of sorting the tree (RB Trees), but also a better function for transplant. That function still doesn't make sense to me.
