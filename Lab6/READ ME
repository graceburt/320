Lab 6

a) 

b) 
   BEST CASE HA: O(1) //we hire everyone
   WORST CASE HA: O(logn) //we hire everyone
   BEST CASE QS: O(nlogn)
   WORST CASE QS: O(n^2)

c) i.) Yes, as it gets larger, it will eventually become logn, as we still have to interview everyone and pick the best candidate.

d) Worst case for hiring algorithm: We hired candidate: 10001 with 6 swaps
15109 miliseconds, and since it is random the chance of absolute worse case is low.

e) :)

f) It definitley could be more randomized, I invision it like a deck being shuffled. You can cut it in half, then cut that in half, and swap those halves, etc.
