a)  Best cases: 

	Quick: O(nlogn)
	Merge: O(nlogn)

	Worst cases: 

	Quick: O(n^2)
	Marge: O(nlogn)

b)	The number of elements in the array definitiely slow down the sort, as adding more numbers to compare makes the process longer. The size of the elements doesn't matter as much as the length of the array. Yes, the timed data can be graphed. 

c) In a case of 100 elements versus 100,000 elements, Quicksort performs in a timely manner, but with 100,000 elements it takes expentionatly longer, at 
d) It does, since Merge completed in a MUCH faster time, which makes sense since MergeSort is the same in best and worse case.
e) Quicksort and Bubblesort have the same Worst case scenario.
f) Just use Mergesort (LOL)
